**INTRODUCTION**
---
This project is an interactive **Streamlit** application designed for learning and practicing
**Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** fundamentals. Users can upload datasets, adjust model parameters, train the model,
and visualize training results and predictions in real time. The app is intended for students and beginners who want to
understand the basics of neural networks and how to build models for classification and regression problems. The
interactive interface helps users intuitively understand MLP structures, activation functions, loss functions, and
optimizers. It allows users to:

- Load and preprocess MNIST data.
- Train a customizable MLP model with real-time metrics visualization.
- Test the trained model on the test dataset.
- Draw digits on a canvas and get instant predictions.

The system is designed to help beginners and enthusiasts explore deep learning concepts in an interactive and visual
way.


**DATA DESCRIPTION**
---
The application comes with built-in sample datasets suitable for supervised learning practice, including:

1. **Nonlinear Classification Dataset (2D)**
    - Features: two-dimensional coordinates `X1` and `X2`
    - Labels: classes `0` or `1`
    - Purpose: practice MLP classification tasks and observe the model's ability to fit nonlinear boundaries.

2. **Regression Dataset (optional)**
    - Features: one or more input dimensions `X`
    - Labels: continuous output `y`
    - Purpose: practice MLP regression tasks and explore how the model fits functions.

Users can also upload their own CSV datasets for training, as long as the format follows **feature columns + label
column** structure.

**FEATURES**
---

- **Data Loading & Preprocessing:** Load MNIST dataset and preprocess for MLP training (flattening and normalization).
- **Model Training:** Train a Multi-Layer Perceptron with configurable epochs, batch size, and validation split.
- **Real-time Training Metrics:** Monitor loss, accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC for both training and validation
  sets.
- **Model Testing:** Evaluate model performance with accuracy and RÂ² score on the test set.
- **Real-time Digit Recognition:** Draw digits on a canvas and get immediate predictions using the trained model.
- **Visualization Tools:** Scatter plots and decision boundary visualization for 2D/3D datasets (for experiments beyond
  MNIST).

**WEB DEVELOPMENT**
---

1. Install NiceGUI with the command `pip install streamlit`.
2. Run the command `pip show streamlit` or `pip show streamlit | grep Version` to check whether the package has been
   installed and its version.
3. Run the command `streamlit run app.py` to start the web application.

**CHANGELOG**
---
This guide outlines the steps to automatically generate and maintain a project changelog using git-changelog.

1. Install the required dependencies with the command `pip install git-changelog`.
2. Run the command `pip show git-changelog` or `pip show git-changelog | grep Version` to check whether the changelog
   package has been installed and its version.
3. Prepare the configuration file of `pyproject.toml` at the root of the file.
4. The changelog style is [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
5. Run the command `git-changelog`, creating the `Changelog.md` file.
6. Add the file `Changelog.md` to version control with the command `git add Changelog.md` or using the UI interface.
7. Run the command `git-changelog --output CHANGELOG.md` committing the changes and updating the changelog.
8. Push the changes to the remote repository with the command `git push origin main` or using the UI interface.
